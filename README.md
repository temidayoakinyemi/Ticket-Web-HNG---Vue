# Ticket Web (Vue Version)

This is the **Vue.js** version of the Ticket Web application, originally built with React.  
The app allows users to **sign up, log in, and manage tickets** efficiently with a clean and responsive UI.  

It uses **Firebase Authentication** for user management and is styled with **modern light blue color tones**, keeping the same design as the React version for consistency.
